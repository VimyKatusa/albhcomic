At Least Be Human is a Canadian webcomic under production by 2 independent Calgary-based artists. 

The story is set on a charming, mountain-high continent, and focuses on a young boy, Cassio Sideon, discovering the potential of a strange figure, rock, 
and fog. Our hope is to present our readers with a highly captivating webcomic with regular updates, active community commentary, and of course, frequent 
content delivery!
